A Software Developer based out of Austin, TX. I currently work as a Web Developer for OroSolutions creating automated financial reports and updating legacy code with C# and .NET.

I graduated from Baylor University in Waco, TX in May 2022, with a Bachlor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS). 

Some of my other notable hobbies include Sim Racing, Car Restoration and working on passion projects, like this website.
